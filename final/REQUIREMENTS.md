# Final Project

**Due Sun, Apr 23 11:59pm PT**

## Submission Instructions

* start from the up-to-date main branch (`git checkout main; git pull origin main`)
* Create a feature branch named 'final' (`git checkout -b final`)
* Create all necessary files for your project here
* add, commit, and push the branch to github
* Create a PR to merge to main
* Be sure to include the TA(s) and myself as reviewer(s)

Hint: Because we've already covered most of the content of this project, the scoring is heavily impacted by attention to detail.  Be sure that I can definitively say that you understand the concepts you are using.  A minimal implementation can leave that unclear.  Use this project as a piece to demonstrate not only to me but also to future employers rather than trying to do the minimum required effort.

## Goal

- Create a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) using create-react-app
- This web app will be about a topic of your choice
  - This can be informational, a game, whatever, your choice
- This web app MUST appear "complete"
  - No fake screens/views/pages
  - No lorem ipsum-like text
  - Appropriately complete visuals
- This web app will have certain required and a selection of optional features (see below)
- This web app will demonstrate your your understanding of the best practices and concepts taught in class
- The web app will be tested by running:
  - `npm install` (once per project)
  - `npm run build`
  - `npx -s serve build`
  - Be sure to run this process to test your application! An improperly written app may work with the dev server from `npm start` and NOT with the above flow!

## Fully Required Features

Your web app MUST feature all of the below, in addition to featuring SOME of the "Partially Required Features"

### Additional Submission Requirements

- Do NOT submit the `build/` directory as part of your commit and PR
  - The project will default to correctly excluding the `build/` directory because create-react-app creates a `.gitignore` file, so just don't break that default behavior

### Required Functionality
Your web app MUST contain and demonstrate these features/abilities/style of writing

- Multiple "pages" for the SPA that replace most/all of the main content
  - Navigation and branding can remain between pages, your choice
  - Your app must consist of at least 3 "pages", but I expect most projects will have more pages than 3 in order to demonstrate all features
- A navigation that allows the user to move from one "page" to another in the SPA
  - A user never has to use the browser "Back" button to use your app
  - A user never has to reload/refresh the page to use your app
- At least one form with some sort of validation that conditionally appears
  - All forms that have input limitations must have validation, there just be at least one such form
- A `<title>` that describes your application

### Required Maintainability

- Your CSS classnames must be semantically descriptive
- Your CSS classnames should be kebab-case or BEM-style
- Your `.css` is done following the practices of class and not using CSS Modules, styled-components, or other styles
  - Not because those other practices are bad, but in order to see that you have learned the general lessons from class
- Your CSS must be in more than one file
- Your `.css` files must be organized to make it easy to find the proper file for styling a given element
- Your `.css` within a file must be organized to make it easier to find/modify the rules and properties for a given element
- Your CSS targets classes unless setting app-wide defaults for elements or targeting specifically unique elements (ex: a skiplink or `#root`)
- Your Components are all `.jsx` files
- Your Components are all in files named for the Component
- Any JS files that are not using JSX are `.js` files
- All `.jsx` and `.css` files are consistently indented
- While the app is tested in Chrome for grading, you must not use CSS/JS features that are not supported in all modern major browsers

### Required Legalities

- Outside images or CSS MUST be in your repository, not linked from outside
- Any images that you use MUST be listed in `images.txt` saying where the image is from and what license allows you to use it
  - Only images from `http://unsplash.com`, `http://placekitten.com`, or images you have the rights to are permitted
    - Placekitten images MUST only be used if appropriate to your topic
- Any outside code (only css.gg is permitted as outside code for this project!) MUST be clearly marked with where it came from and what license allows you to use it

### Required Visuals

- You MUST have an identifiable color palette for your site that goes well together
- Different areas of the "pages" of your SPA MUST appear visually distinct and have whitespace and boundaries that are sufficient and helpful for the user
- The app must appear to be "complete"
  - No placeholder text
  - No placeholder images
  - No links to non-existent content
    - Exception: Links to social media accounts can link to other accounts
  - Content the user would expect is present

### Required Responsive/Adaptive Behavior

Your web app MUST demonstrate these responsive/adaptive behaviors
- General Responsive behavior that allows the page to be readable and clear at any viewport sizes in between adaptive breakpoints (between 360px and 1200px widths at standard font size)
- At least one Adaptive breakpoint 

### Required Accessibility

Your web app MUST demonstrate these accessibility features

- You must use Semantic HTML when there is a clearly appropriate semantic HTML element for the purpose
- You must use landmark HTML elements where appropriate
  - Ex: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`
  - `<article>` and `<section>` have subtle semantics and their use is not required for this project but they are recommended when you are confident you are using them properly
- Any heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc) must be properly used
  - They are used for titles of content that is a subsection of the previous heading
  - No levels in between are skipped
- ALL foreground images must have a useful and accurate `alt` attribute
  - "useful" and "accurate" are IMPORTANT.  It is not enough to have alt text if that alt text is not helpful to someone using it.
  - For this project, that includes any "logo" images
- Any image in the background MUST NOT display relevant information to the user
- All font sizes must be in rem units
- Your pages must remain readable/usable when zoomed in up to 200%
- All controls and form fields must be accessible/usable via both keyboard and mouse
  - The skiplink need only be usable by keyboard
- You must have a skiplink that works when the app is loaded
  - Each "page" should work with the skiplink
- You must pass WCAG contrast requirements for AA level
- All form fields must have an appropriate `<label>` element properly associated with the data
- Any controls must have an accessible text description
  - Ex: Button text, an associated `<label>` element, or an `aria-label` attribute
  - This should NOT include error messages for the element, only the label text
- You do not use color as the only indicator for information to the user
- Nothing automatically rotates/advances
- Any animation or transition CSS MUST be in a media query that blocks the motion for users that have `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Partially Required Features

You must implement at least 5 of these features following the practices from class:

- Drop down navigation menu
  - the menu drops down on click or drops down on hover/focus, your choice of which trigger causes the dropdown
- An adaptive "hamburger menu"
  - A menu that is visible at larger viewport size, but is replaced with a dropdown menu at smaller viewport sizes (this counts as a dropdown as well if done)
- Accordions or Tabs 
- Theme selection (switching between a light or a dark theme) that then applies to all "pages" in the SPA
  - The option to change theme can be on all pages or in some "Settings" page, your choice
- Cards or Panels that include an image and text grouped together visually
  - This option must have sufficient styling to be noteworthy
- A Carousel of images (where one image is shown at a time)
- A "gallery" that shows many items (images/cards/panels/etc) that can be filtered or sorted or otherwise changes which items are shown   
- A "complex" form interaction (Ex: Specific Fields that appear/show or use a different input type based on criteria). Examples of complex form interactions:
  - A dropdown with "other" that shows an additional field to fill in what "other" is when selected, but if you pick something from the dropdown that isn't "other", the extra field isn't shown
  - A shipping address and billing address where  a checkbox says "billing address same as shipping address" and when you check it the billing address is pre-filled and the fields are given the "readonly" attribute so that they can't be edited.  Unchecking the box makes those fields editable again.  
  - Two select dropdowns where the selection in the first changes the options for the second, like selecting the make and model of a car (changing the "make" selection changes what is available in the dropdown for "model"). 
- A Modal form that alters some data shown in the app.  Examples of "altering some data shown in the app" include changing your Display Name in Slack or changing if emails are shown in "Compact" mode in Gmail

Any of these options implemented using techniques NOT based on class will not count towards the requirement

## Extra Credit

Extra credit points should be worked on only after fulfilling all the other requirements, because the other requirements are worth more points than the extra credit is

- You can earn extra credit by including more partially required features than required
- You can earn extra credit by having more UI or UX "complexity" than required
  - Basically, if the app involves additional effort THAT USES SKILLS FROM CLASS to IMPROVE UX, it can earn extra credit
- Extra credit is based on these criteria:
  - Are you demonstrating skills learned from class?
  - Do these demonstrations show sufficiently complex understanding?
  - Do these demonstrations provide benefit to the User Experience (UX)?

## Additional Requirements
- Follow the best practices from the course
- Do not use HTML-based form validation (including type="email", use type="text" instead)
- Do not use float unless wrapping text around an image
- Do not use tables or table-layouts unless showing a table of data
- Do not use iframes or otherwise load external content except as explicitly allowed/directed by this README
- I/TA(s) must be able to examine and evaluate your understanding of the course lessons
  - Meaning: We have to be able to look at your HTML/CSS and be able to tell if you have  learned the lessons based one what we read
- Do not use any CSS preprocessor (SASS/Less/etc)
- Do not use external CSS
  - Exception: You MAY link to outside webfonts 
  - Exception: You MAY use icons from css.gg by copying the CSS snippet(s) into your own css file
    - You MUST include a comment in your CSS saying "below CSS adapted from https://css.gg under the MIT License"
    - You MAY modify/adapt/rename the CSS from css.gg.  The comment will still apply
- Any images must be ones you personally own, be from placekitten.com, or be from `http://unsplash.com`  
  - If you include any images in your repo, you must include a `images.txt` file in your repo (at the same level as package.json, not in `public/`) and list the url of each image you downloaded along with the url of the license allowing you to use those images
  - For any images that you personally own and used, list (in `images.txt`) the filename of that image as you have it in this project, and list your name as the owner.
  - Do NOT download and use random images from the internet/web.  Only use images from the listed sites (or you own) and that you have permission to use
- Do not use any additional JS libraries or external JS
  - NO react-router, NO libraries of components, etc
  - Such libraries are not bad, but this project is to demonstrate YOUR skills
- Do not use alert(), prompt(), or other blocking JS that wasn't introduced in class
- Do not use redirects
- Do not use cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, or other client-side storage.  Store any data in Component state for this project.
- Do not modify the DOM in any way outside of using React
- Do not read the DOM outside of using the event target to capture values from form fields
